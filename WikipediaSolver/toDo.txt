Make sure goalString is always capitalized

satisiablePercent = .8
# .75 changes which pages are visited
start = "Science"
goalString = "Dog"
goal = wordnet.synset("dog.n.01")

satisfiablePercent = .7
start = "United_States"
goalString = "Dog"
goal = wordnet.synset("dog.n.01")

satisfiablePercent = .7
# increasing percent to .95 makes this take a longer path
start = "hat"
goalString = "cat"
goal = wordnet.synset("cat.n.01")

satisfiablePercent = .75
start = "Couch"
goalString = "Chair"
goal = wordnet.synset("Chair.n.01")

You can reach the goal in 1 steps.
['Couch', u'Furniture', 'Chair']


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Was not able to run:

satisfiablePercent = .7
start = "Couch"
goalString = "Lamp"
goal = wordnet.synset("Lamp.n.01")

After implementing error handling for a satisfiablePercent that is not reachable
by any of the current obtainable links:

satisfiablePercent = .8
# changing to .9 makes the path different
start = "Couch"
goalString = "Lamp"
goal = wordnet.synset("Lamp.n.01")

['Couch', u'Cushion', u'Car_seat', u'Headlamp', u'Laser', u'Optical_discs', u'Optical_disc',

u'Streetlight', u'Mercury-vapor_lamp', u'Fluorescent_lamp', u'Lantern', u'Kerosene_lamp',
u'Oil_lamp', 'Lamp']
You can reach the goal in 18 steps.


Before implementation this vas not solvable:

satisfiablePercent = .9
# changing satisfiablePercent to .95 makes the program take a longer path
start = "computer"
goalString = "science"
goal = wordnet.synset("science.n.01")

After implementation this was the output:

['computer', u'Cryptography', u'Mathematics', 'science']
You can reach the goal in 2 steps.

I thought this was pretty funny:

satisfiablePercent = .9
# decreasing satisfiablePercent to .8 reduces path to 5
start = "poop"
goalString = "dog"
goal = wordnet.synset("dog.n.01")

You can reach the goal in 6 steps.
['poop', u'Stern', u'Winch', u'Aristotle', u'Animal', u'Carnivore', u'Hyaena', u'Hyena']


satisfiablePercent = .8
start = "douche"
goalString = "toupee"
goal = wordnet.synset("toupee.n.01")

You can reach the goal in 9 steps.

u'Clothing', u'Headgear', u'Cap', u'Clothing', u'Cloth']


satisfiablePercent = .8
start = "dank"
goalString = "meme"
goal = wordnet.synset("meme.n.01")

['dank', '', u'Witchcraft', u'Wisdom', u'Ignorance', u'Knowledge', u'Thought', u'Cognition',

You can reach the goal in 10 steps.

PROOF OUR BIDIRECTIONAL WORKS:

satisfiablePercent = .8
start = "indiana"
goalString = "Mouse"
goal = wordnet.synset("mouse.n.01")

Mastodons

You can reach the goal in 3 steps.

Some proper nouns are usable: Indiana (all states and countries)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

satisfiablePercent = .8
# reducing the % to .6 makes the program run faster, but also visit more pages.
start = "divorce"
goalString = "Margarine"
goal = wordnet.synset("margarine.n.01")

Performing bidirectional where the goal node looks for the last node start visited
is actually fucking terrible. Need to instead implement two nextPage functions.
